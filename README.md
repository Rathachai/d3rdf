# d3rdf

## Description
This project uses force layout of D3 to represent the expresion subject–predicate–object, which is as known as triple in RDF terminology in semantic web and linked data. This code modifies the code from Force-Directed Graph<sup>1<sup> by adding a label for every node node (resource: subject or object), and an arrow and a label for every edge (predicate).

## Codes

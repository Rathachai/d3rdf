# D3RDF

## Description
This project uses force layout of D3<sup>1</sup> to visualize the expression "subject–predicate–object", a.k.a. a triple in RDF terminology, under semantic web and linked data domains. It is implemented on top of the Force-Directed Graph<sup>2</sup> by adding a label for every node (resource: subject or object), and an arrow and a label for every edge (predicate).

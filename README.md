# D3RDF

## Description
This project uses force layout of D3<sup>1</sup> to visualize the expresion subject–predicate–object, which is as known as triple in RDF terminology, in semantic web and linked data. It is implemented on top of the Force-Directed Graph<sup>2</sup> by adding a label for every node (resource: subject or object), and an arrow and a label for every edge (predicate).

## Codes
